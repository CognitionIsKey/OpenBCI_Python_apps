# OpenBCI Applications

This is a library containing simple standalone python applications for the [OpenBCI](https://github.com/OpenBCI) device.

### Applications:

- Impedance measurement for OpenBCI Ganglion
- Canonical Correlation Analysis for OpenBCI Ganglion

## Getting Started

These are standalone applications for use with OpenBCI Ganglion or without it - [OpenBCI Simulator](https://github.com/CognitionIsKey/OpenBCI_Python_apps/tree/master/CCA_Live_OpenBCI_Ganglion/OpenBCI_Simulator)

For now, OpenBCI_Simulator is under development and future options like generating impedance values will be implemented soon. Simulator can be used with CCA application.

#### Impedance measurement for OpenBCI Ganglion

- Little GUI to measure electrodes impedance on Ganglion device.

#### Canonical Correlation Analysis for OpenBCI Ganglion

- *WIP*

### Prerequisites:

To use these applications you will need:

```
numpy
sklearn
scipy
```

or simply install [Anaconda](anaconda.org/)

### Installing:

Install by:

```
git clone https://github.com/CognitionIsKey/OpenBCI_Python_apps.git
```
